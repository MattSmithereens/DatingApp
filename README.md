# DatingApp

So I'm not really looking to date or build an actual dating app, but I'm taking this opportunity to catch back up on Angular JS and ASPNET core with a project that blends the 2.  This is based off of [Neil Cummings'](https://www.udemy.com/user/neil-cummings-2/) course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/build-an-app-with-aspnet-core-and-angular-from-scratch/)
